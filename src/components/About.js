      <p>
        Hello, and welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Mendel Rosenblum,
        and I am thrilled to share my journey with you. At the age of 17, I
        embarked on an accelerated EMT course and graduated as the
        valedictorian, marking the beginning of my career in emergency medical
        services. I am currently a licensed NREMT (National Registry of
        Emergency Medical Technicians) professional, certified as an EMT in both
        New Jersey and New York. Over the past three years, I have had the
        privilege of serving as an NYC 911 EMT, responding to emergencies and
        providing critical care to those in need. It has been an incredibly
        rewarding experience, allowing me to make a positive impact on people's
        lives during their most vulnerable moments. In addition to my work in
        New York City, I have dedicated the past two years to volunteering as an
        EMT in New Jersey. The Township of Livingston recognized my commitment
        and contribution to the community by awarding me the prestigious
        Presidential Award. This recognition has further fueled my passion for
        helping others and solidified my dedication to the field. Continuing my
        education and professional growth, I am currently pursuing a NREMT
        paramedic certification, scheduled to be completed by August 2023.
        Alongside my studies, I have taken on the exciting challenge of
        attending a software engineering bootcamp at Flarion, focusing on
        developing my skills in the tech field. This pivot into technology
        offers me a unique perspective and enables me to blend my passion for
        healthcare with my growing interest in software engineering. Even as I
        explore the realm of technology, emergency medicine remains a vital part
        of who I am. I will continue to practice as a paramedic, considering it
        not just a profession but also a personal hobby. This combination allows
        me to apply my medical expertise while pursuing my enthusiasm for
        technology. I am delighted to showcase my experiences, achievements, and
        projects through this portfolio website. I hope you find inspiration in
        my journey and witness the diverse skill set I bring to the table. Thank
        you for visiting, and please feel free to reach out if you have any
        questions or opportunities you'd like to discuss. Let's connect and make
        a difference together.
